# Marketing-Analytics
Project focusing on the acquisition of one company by another. Focus was on operations before and after the merger. 

Marketing-Analytics
For this project I looked at the acquisition of a small company, 'A', by another small company, 'B'. I am most interested in looking at how A was functioning prior to the acquisition.

How many clients did the company have and what information was the company compiling from which I can gain information?
How productive was the company? How did their client base change?
What is the analysis of the company's take rate?
Is a new interface statistically more profitable for the company?
What was the effect of a change in marketing strategy?
